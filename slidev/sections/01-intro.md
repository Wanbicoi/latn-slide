# LATN Project: Annotation System for Medical Data with Smart Assistance

## Problem Overview
- Medical image annotation remains a critical bottleneck in healthcare AI
- Vietnamese hospitals struggle with inefficient manual annotation processes
- Fragmented team coordination and limited AI integration
- Significant burden on medical experts limiting scalability

## Key Challenges
- **Expertise Requirements**: Complex anatomical structures requiring specialized knowledge
- **Time Constraints**: Manual annotation extremely time-consuming
- **Inter-observer Variability**: Inconsistency between different experts
- **Resource Limitations**: Limited qualified experts and expensive processes

## Our Solution
An intelligent annotation system integrating AI effectively into clinical workflows to:
- ‚úÖ Reduce manual workload substantially
- ‚úÖ Improve efficiency and quality of data labeling
- ‚úÖ Enable structured collaboration between doctors and annotation staff
- ‚úÖ Provide AI-assisted segmentation with interactive refinement
